# ASCII Game U
This is a game that is made using only ASCII keys and for the Nintendo WiiU game console!

## What is it?
**ASCII Game U** is a really good game that is going to be made for the WiiU. This game will be really fun and only use _ascii_ characters that can be found on your keyboard or online. This game will be controlled with the DPad and similar to pacman I think. I will be working on this game starting today and hopefully release the first build of it in 1-2 days. If you want direct updates, you will be able to find this game on the Homebrew Store for WiiU when it is publicly released!  

## When can I expect it?
Like I said briefely in the last section, this game will be publicly available in 1-2 days and can be downloaded from here as well as the **WiiU Homebrew Store**. This game will be worked on semi-daily and hopefully fully finished before may of 2024. If for some reason it isn't finished by then, I will update this _readme.md_ to give reasoning behind the delay.  

## The Team
For this game, I will be working by myself for the development, resources, ect but I will have support from a close friend of mine **YourZipper**. I hope that he will help me a bit with the development of this game because I am not the best when it comes to coding in the **c** language. This being said, I really hope that having **YourZipper** on the team will help speed up the development process to meet the deadline.  

If there are any bugs, **PLEASE REPORT THEM!**. Bug reporting (although seems useless) really helps us make the game good. The more bugs we can find and exterminate, the better and smoother the game will be. 

I really hope you are ready to play some awesome levels in this game and I really hope you are ready to play hard because this game is going to be huge for just ASCII characters.
